# -Gmail-Cleanup-Automation-using-Python

**Project Overview**
This Python project is built using the Gmail API, allowing users to automatically clean up unwanted promotional, social, and subscription emails from specific senders or by keyword. It moves them to trash and immediately empties it â€” all without storing any credentials, ensuring privacy and security.

âœ… **Key Features**
No token storage â€“ No need to save any token.json or pickle file.
Multi-label filtering â€“ Customize filters for brands like Zomato, Amazon, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
One-click cleanup â€“ Automatically trash and permanently delete selected mails.
Instant trash emptying â€“ No need to manually delete from trash again.
User privacy-first â€“ All operations happen live during screen sharing (ideal for freelancing clients).

ðŸ§  **How I Designed It**
I built this project with a focus on:

Minimal code (clean, understandable for non-developers too)
User-friendliness, especially useful for clients who don't want to share credentials
Scalability â€“ easily modify filters or add more labels
Transparency â€“ Every step is printed live on the screen during execution

**Technologies used:**
Python 3
Google API Client
OAuth2 Flow
No token pickle or stored login session

ðŸ“ˆ Why This Project Matters
Many people continue to pay Google for storage upgrades simply because of a cluttered inbox. This tool shows how with the right automation, even a non-tech user can regain control over their mailbox.

ðŸ’¼ Ideal for Freelancers & Recruiters
Freelancers can use this tool to:

Offer inbox decluttering as a service
Earn client trust by not asking for credentials
Add value using screen-sharing sessions for live cleanup
